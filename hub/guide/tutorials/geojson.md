# Using GeoJSON with Leaflet

GeoJSON is a very popular data format among many GIS technologies and services — it's simple, lightweight, straightforward, and Leaflet is quite good at handling it. In this example, you'll learn how to create and interact with map vectors created from [GeoJSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) objects.

### About GeoJSON

According to [GeoJSON Specification (RFC 7946)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946):

> GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures […]. A GeoJSON object may represent a region of space (a Geometry), a spatially bounded entity (a Feature), or a list of Features (a FeatureCollection). GeoJSON supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection. Features in GeoJSON contain a Geometry object and additional properties, and a FeatureCollection contains a list of Features.

Leaflet supports all of the GeoJSON types above, but [Features](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) and [FeatureCollections](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3) work best as they allow you to describe features with a set of properties. We can even use these properties to style our Leaflet vectors. Here's an example of a simple GeoJSON feature:

```js
const geojsonFeature = {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Coors Field",
        "amenity": "Baseball Stadium",
        "popupContent": "This is where the Rockies play!"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-104.99404, 39.75621]
    }
};
```

### The GeoJSON layer

GeoJSON objects are added to the map through a [GeoJSON layer](/reference.html#geojson). To create it and add it to a map, we can use the following code:

```js
new GeoJSON(geojsonFeature).addTo(map);
```

GeoJSON objects may also be passed as an array of valid GeoJSON objects.

```js
const myLines = [{
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [[-100, 40], [-105, 45], [-110, 55]]
}, {
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [[-105, 40], [-110, 45], [-115, 55]]
}];
```

Alternatively, we could create an empty GeoJSON layer and assign it to a variable so that we can add more features to it later.

```js
const myLayer = new GeoJSON().addTo(map);
myLayer.addData(geojsonFeature);
```

### Options

#### style
The `style` option can be used to style features two different ways. First, we can pass a simple object that styles all paths (polylines and polygons) the same way:

```js
const myLines = [{
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [[-100, 40], [-105, 45], [-110, 55]]
}, {
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [[-105, 40], [-110, 45], [-115, 55]]
}];

const myStyle = {
    "color": "#ff7800",
    "weight": 5,
    "opacity": 0.65
};

new GeoJSON(myLines, {
    style: myStyle
}).addTo(map);
```

Alternatively, we can pass a function that styles individual features based on their properties. In the example below we check the "party" property and style our polygons accordingly:

```js
const states = [{
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {"party": "Republican"},
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[
            [-104.05, 48.99],
            [-97.22,  48.98],
            [-96.58,  45.94],
            [-104.03, 45.94],
            [-104.05, 48.99]
        ]]
    }
}, {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {"party": "Democrat"},
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[
            [-109.05, 41.00],
            [-102.06, 40.99],
            [-102.03, 36.99],
            [-109.04, 36.99],
            [-109.05, 41.00]
        ]]
    }
}];

new GeoJSON(states, {
    style(feature) {
        switch (feature.properties.party) {
            case 'Republican': return {color: "#ff0000"};
            case 'Democrat':   return {color: "#0000ff"};
        }
    }
}).addTo(map);
```

#### pointToLayer

Points are handled differently than polylines and polygons. By default simple markers are drawn for GeoJSON Points. We can alter this by passing a `pointToLayer` function in a [GeoJSON options](/reference.html#geojson) object when creating the GeoJSON layer. This function is passed a [LatLng](/reference.html#latlng) and should return an instance of ILayer, in this case likely a [Marker](/reference.html#marker) or [CircleMarker](/reference.html#circlemarker).

Here we're using the `pointToLayer` option to create a CircleMarker:

```js
const geojsonMarkerOptions = {
    radius: 8,
    fillColor: "#ff7800",
    color: "#000",
    weight: 1,
    opacity: 1,
    fillOpacity: 0.8
};

new GeoJSON(someGeojsonFeature, {
    pointToLayer(feature, latlng) {
        return new CircleMarker(latlng, geojsonMarkerOptions);
    }
}).addTo(map);
```

We could also set the `style` property in this example &mdash; Leaflet is smart enough to apply styles to GeoJSON points if you create a vector layer like circle inside the `pointToLayer` function.

#### onEachFeature

The `onEachFeature` option is a function that gets called on each feature before adding it to a GeoJSON layer. A common reason to use this option is to attach a popup to features when they are clicked.

```js
function onEachFeature(feature, layer) {
    // does this feature have a property named popupContent?
    if (feature.properties && feature.properties.popupContent) {
        layer.bindPopup(feature.properties.popupContent);
    }
}

const geojsonFeature = {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Coors Field",
        "amenity": "Baseball Stadium",
        "popupContent": "This is where the Rockies play!"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-104.99404, 39.75621]
    }
};

new GeoJSON(geojsonFeature, {
    onEachFeature: onEachFeature
}).addTo(map);
```

#### filter

The `filter` option can be used to control the visibility of GeoJSON features. To accomplish this we pass a function as the `filter` option. This function gets called for each feature in your GeoJSON layer, and gets passed the `feature` and the `layer`. You can then utilise the values in the feature's properties to control the visibility by returning `true` or `false`.

In the example below "Busch Field" will not be shown on the map.

```js
const someFeatures = [{
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Coors Field",
        "show_on_map": true
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-104.99404, 39.75621]
    }
}, {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Busch Field",
        "show_on_map": false
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-104.98404, 39.74621]
    }
}];

new GeoJSON(someFeatures, {
    filter(feature, layer) {
        return feature.properties.show_on_map;
    }
}).addTo(map);
```
